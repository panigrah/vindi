          description: "Impactful deep plum aromas with hints of raspberry jam and the feeling of fresh ocean spray open your mind to the tasting experience to ensue. The first entry to the pallet is silky smooth and opens with delicately assembled blackberry, plum, and peach cobbler, all supported by a dusty tannin structure which is complemented by a mouthwatering sensation approximately five seconds from the beginning of the experience. The finish is lengthy and subtle with hints of South American coffee and heath candies.",
