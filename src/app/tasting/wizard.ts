NOSE
- clean - no off smells
- not clean - smell of 
 - tainted cork, wet newspaper - wines bad
 - brettanomycis - horse stable, bandaid - bad
 - sulfur - can wait for the wine to "breathe" and blow off

 intensity - how to measure

 Aroma descriptors - see wheel

 development
- youthful - more fruity and floral from the grapes - green, citrus, stone, tropical
- developing - can smell more of oaky, nutty, buttery, creamy
- developed - a lot more from aging - coffee, toffee, caramel, chocolate, vnialla, toast, musrhoom, earthy..
- past developed - is extreme on the developed side.

The more fruit you can smell and taste in a wine, the more youthful it likely is.

acidity:
- tricks:
This is the sensation of sourness and freshness in a wine. This is a good thing, as it preserves the wine and it gives its backbone. It also makes it refreshing to drink.
I find very difficult to judge wine acidity if the fruits in the wine are very ripe, especially in a red wine.  One trick I leaned to do from school: you swirl the wine in your mouth and then you spit and tip your head forward. If a waterfall of saliva comes down in your mouth, the wine has a high acidity. Other people can detect acidity as a tingling on their gums.
I tried using the Litmus paper, dipping it in every tasted wine, but wine is an acidic drink, no matter if we call it a low acidity or a high acidity. Unfortunately, that was a dead end.
It will take some time until you calibrate the acidity perception. As a rule of thumb, a saliva waterfall, means always high acidity. Somewhere in the middle is medium. Almost nothing, low acidity.

Tannin
Tannin is extracted from red grape skins, grape stems, seeds and oak. It is the mouth drying and astringent sensation that you feel on your gums. If you drink black coffee or black tea, you will easily identify the sensation. Tannin is an important component in red wine (and a few whites). If it comes from the grape itself, this helps a wine have a longer ageing potential. As a rule, the thicker the grape skin, the higher the tannin. The good news is that tannin becomes milder and more integrated with the wine as it ages.
Of course, there are different levels of tannins in the wine.  This was easy for me in determining which one is low, medium or high. You just need to taste a Pinot Noir (low tannin), a Malbec or Merlot (medium tannin) and a Cabernet Sauvignon or Nebbiolo (high tannin) in the same tasting and you will figure out easily which one is which.

Alcohol
 wines above 13% abv start slightly burning my gums. Other people feel a sensation of warmth at the back of their mouth.

Body
A light body wine will feel very watery in your mouth (as if you are having water with different flavours). A full body will feel like a juice with pulp, with a lot of things going on and a bite to it. You can almost chew it. A medium body will be like a normal juice, somewhere in the middle. A lot of wine text books use the comparison with skimmed milk, semi-skimmed and full milk. 
You also need to be aware that a high acidity makes wine feel lighter in body, while sugar, higher levels of tannin, alcohol might affect the sensation of body.

Finish
Finish is the aftertaste that stays in your mouth after you spat or swallowed the wine. You should note down your impressions on the finish and the length. Was it a pleasant? Was there something that you didn’t like about it?
In the wine assessment, finish can be short, medium or long. A short finish lasts for only a couple of seconds. This is usually found in generic, inexpensive wines.  A medium finish lasts up to one minute, while a long finish can last a minute and more, triggering layers of pleasant taste in your mouth, after you spat or swallowed. A long finish is the attribute of a fine wine.
I tend to chew a bit and make a mental record of what flavours I get and for how long they last before I make my assessment.
